  /*The JSClock function first creates a new Date object called time;
  since no arguments are given, time is created with the current date and time. 
  Then calls to the getHours, getMinutes, and getSeconds methods assign the value
  of the current hour, minute and seconds to hour, minute, and second.

The next four statements build a string value based on the time. 
The first statement creates a variable temp, assigning it a value using a 
conditional expression; if hour is greater than 12, (hour - 12), 
otherwise simply hour, unless hour is 0, in which case it becomes 12.

The next statement appends a minute value to temp. 
If the value of minute is less than 10, the conditional 
expression adds a string with a preceding zero; otherwise 
it adds a string with a demarcating colon. Then a statement 
appends a seconds value to temp in the same way.

Finally, a conditional expression appends "PM" to temp 
if hour is 12 or greater; otherwise, it appends "AM" to temp.*/
